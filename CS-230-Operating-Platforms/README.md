CS‑230: Operating Platforms

This folder contains my portfolio artifact for CS‑230: Operating Platforms, part of the SNHU Computer Science program. The course focused on understanding operating system architectures, distributed systems, platform constraints, and the process of designing software that can run reliably across multiple environments.

Artifact Included:

Draw It or Lose It – Software Design Document

This document represents my completed software design for The Gaming Room, a client seeking to expand their Android game into a scalable, web‑based, multi‑platform application.

The design covers:
- Business and technical requirements
- Design constraints
- Domain model and UML class structure
- Evaluation of operating platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, mobile)
- Final architectural recommendations
- Security, scalability, and distributed‑system considerations
  
The full document is located in the project‑level folder:

/CS-230-Operating-Platforms/Draw-It-or-Lose-It-Design-Template/

Purpose of This Artifact

This design document demonstrates my ability to:
- Analyze client requirements
- Evaluate operating platforms and architectural tradeoffs
- Apply object‑oriented design principles
- Communicate technical decisions clearly and professionally
- Design a distributed, web‑based system from the ground up

It serves as a strong example of my technical writing, architectural reasoning, and ability to translate user needs into a complete software design.

Reflection

A full reflection on this artifact — including what I learned, what I did well, and how I would improve the work — is included in the project‑level README within the Draw It or Lose It folder.
