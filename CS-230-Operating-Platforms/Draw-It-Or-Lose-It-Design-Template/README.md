Portfolio Reflection

Summary of the Client and Requirements
- Client: The Gaming Room
- Project Goal: Expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It into a web‑based, multi‑platform application.
- Key Requirements:
- Support Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile browsers
- Enforce unique game, team, and player identifiers
- Maintain a single active game instance in memory
- Provide real‑time drawing, guessing, and synchronized game state
- Deliver a consistent user experience across all platforms

What I Did Well
- I clearly translated the client’s requirements into practical architectural decisions.
- The Domain Model section was especially strong, demonstrating how object‑oriented principles supported the game’s structure.
- I explained not just what the system needed, but why certain design choices were necessary.

Helpful Parts of the Design Process
- Creating the design document before coding helped me:
- Build a clear mental model of the system
- Understand relationships between components
- Reduce rework during development
- Approach coding with confidence and structure

What I Would Revise
- I would enhance the System Architecture View with a more detailed visual diagram.
- A diagram showing client–server interactions, database flow, and real‑time communication would make the architecture even clearer for both technical and non‑technical stakeholders.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
- I considered both the client’s goals (scalability, maintainability, security) and the players’ needs (smooth, responsive gameplay).
- I implemented these needs by:
- Choosing platform‑independent technologies
- Designing for real‑time communication
- Enforcing strict uniqueness and game‑state rules
- Considering user needs is essential because software must align with real‑world expectations to deliver value.

My Approach to Software Design
- I used a modular, scalable, and layered approach.
- Key strategies included:
- Requirements analysis
- UML modeling
- Object‑oriented design principles
- Distributed‑system best practices
- In future projects, I would continue using these techniques to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with client goals before writing any code.
